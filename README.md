# Built Using
- HTML - Skeleton of the website.
- CSS - Used for styling.
- JavaScript - Used for the actual functionality of the project.

#   Trials I Experienced
- Getting the end generated password to display in the password field.
- I misspelt a couple things as well which caused my javascript to toss errors all over the place.
- One of the hardest fixes was, I initially made the password generator which was pretty simple all around. However, I found that when the user clicked cancel to stop the script entirely... it did not know how to get back to the beginning. 
- Allowing the script to check if the password is 8 characters min or 128 characters max was pretty hard too. Reason being is because I just didn't know the generator needed such specification.
